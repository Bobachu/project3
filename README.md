# GameAdvisor

## Goal
The goal of this project is to help parents understand video game ratings and screen content for their children. We are hoping to make this as user friendly and easy to understand as possible.

## MVP
* Easy to use, video games for dummies format.
* Upon entering a game title the user will see a game information and box art as well as links to live 'twitch video' of the actual game.
* The user will also recieve the 'ESRB' and 'commonsensemedia' ratings for each game. 
* These ratings include for example any sexual content or excessive violence.
* User accounts
 * Allow users to log in and wishlist games
